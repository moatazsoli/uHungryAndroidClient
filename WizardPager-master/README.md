Wizard Pager is a library that provides an example implementation of a Wizard UI on Android, it's based of Roman Nurik's wizard pager (https://github.com/romannurik/android-wizardpager)

I've updated Roman's code to use the latest support library, it is now structured as a library project, and it's backwards compatible with Android 2.2

Download
============

You can get the library via Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.techfreak</groupId>
  <artifactId>wizardpager</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
  <type>aar</type>
</dependency>
```

or Gradle:

```groovy
dependencies {
   compile 'com.github.techfreak:wizardpager:1.0.0'
}
```


Usage
============

There is a sample implementation, so you can see how to add this library to your project. The example uses ActionBarCompat.
